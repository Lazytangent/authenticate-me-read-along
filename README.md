# Authenticate Me Read-Along

This reading is meant to accompany the Authenticate Me project that's set for
the end of Week 15 in the Online Curriculum.

## Project Setup

The instructions advise you to create an `authenticate-me` folder as the root of
your project with a `backend` and `frontend` folder nested within the root
folder, like so:

```plaintext
authenticate-me
├── backend
└── frontend
```

You should initialize a git repository inside the `authenticate-me` directory,
so that when you push to GitHub, GitHub will show the `backend` and `frontend`
directories in the root of the project. When you first push to GitHub, if all
you've made is the `backend` and `frontend` directories, then nothing will show
up since git will not track empty folders.

## `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file is meant to be created at the root of your project.
