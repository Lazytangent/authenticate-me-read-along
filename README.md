# Authenticate Me Read-Along

This reading is meant to accompany the Authenticate Me project that's set for
the end of Week 15 in the Online Curriculum.

## Project Setup

The instructions advise you to create an `authenticate-me` folder as the root of
your project with a `backend` and `frontend` folder nested within the root
folder, like so:

```plaintext
authenticate-me
├── backend
└── frontend
```

You should initialize a git repository inside the `authenticate-me` directory,
so that when you push to GitHub, GitHub will show the `backend` and `frontend`
directories in the root of the project. When you first push to GitHub, if all
you've made is the `backend` and `frontend` directories, then nothing will show
up since git will not track empty folders.

## `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file is meant to be created at the root of your project.

## Dependencies

Make sure to grab the versions mentioned in the instructions. Using Sequelize v6
is not much different, but the models generated will be different from the code
examples in the instructions, so be wary.

## Sequelize Setup

While the instructions mention that you'll be setting up the
`backend/config/database.js` file, you'll do that after doing two other things
first.

The `.sequelizerc` file needs to go in your `backend` directory, and needs to be
created BEFORE you run the `npx sequelize init` command. If your
`backend/.sequelizerc` file is properly set up, then running the `npx sequelize
init` command should create the following files and folders:

* `backend/config/database.js` - this is the database config file
* `backend/db/migrations/` - this is the migrations folder
* `backend/db/models/` - this is the models folder
* `backend/db/models/index.js` - this is the file that sets up your Sequelize
    instance to interact with your database through your models
* `backend/db/seeders/` - this is the seeders folder

If you find a `backend/db/config.json`, `backend/db/config/config.json`, or
something similar, you'll run into issues with development in just a second when
testing the setup out. There are a few ways to solve this, but the fastest is
probably just to remove the files and folders that were generated by the
Sequelize initialization command, make sure that your `backend/.sequelizerc`
file is set up properly, and run the `npx sequelize init` command again. If this
error continues to occur, call in a TA for assistance.
